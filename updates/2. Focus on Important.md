# Focus on Important.
###### 2022-02-28 Update.

### In today's Unite DAO team meeting, we decided a few things:

- We need to focus on Provable Skills.
- We need to launch DAO as soon as possible.



The focus is on doing a "Skill NFT" as the first use case.

We will make an NFT sale, where NFT buyers need to be verified/recommended. 1000 NFTs at 1 ETH price.

*There will be an update in GitHub very soon (White paper).*



### Our next steps are:

1. Update the GitHub (White paper).

2. Decide on which DAO/Reward system tool we can work with.

3. Prepare a Token linked to the DAO. (Qty?)

4. Launch a website with basic info.

5. Build a CRM for partners/collaborators.

6. Design Code for the Skill NFT.



We'll have a Zoom call on 2022-03-02 at 1 pm to talk about Token preparation (#3) and NFT Sale.
