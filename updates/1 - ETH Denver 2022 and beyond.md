UNITE DAO ETH DENVER


UNITE DAO aims to become a decentralized community focused on
constant evolution of STANDARS for the whole btockchcain ecosystem.

We believe standard are a public good. This means that they should be fu people who make them and 
maintain them should be paid well.

During the past month, we have been thinking about how our Tokenomics should look like and the main 
features of the protocol native token, FI DE. Finally, we arrived to two main conclusions.

The first one, FI DE will give voting power over the DAO, the selection and creation of
standards.
The second one, FI DE must catch the long-term value creation of UNITE DAO in order to guarantee 
financial sustainability.

Said that, we knew that, to start the project, we needed three things:
A multidisciplinary core team committed and involved with the project.
An initial amount of capital to bankroll the first phases of UNITE DAO development.
A community conformed by key partners within the ecosystem.

So that we did. Now, we have a team, and we have the partners. People, protocols and DAOS who want 
to join this awesome community.

The time to decide how to raise funds has come.

We had in mind a couple of ideas, such as a TBE and a potential tokenswap. None of them were good 
enough for us.

So finally, we realized the best way to raise funds and create a community simultaneously is
a GENESIS EVENT.

Soon we will give more details about our next steps. The WHEN and HOW still need to be
confirmed.

For more details, join us today at 3pm to learn more about UniteDAO and become part of the 
community
