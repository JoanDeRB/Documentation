# DAO Structure

# Introduction to UNITE DAO Structure
As its name shows, UNITE DAO aims to be a decentralized protocol driven by the community. 

Initially, the development of standards will be focused on 4 “verticals”, even more working groups will be added later:
-Protocol
-Metaverse
-Compliance
-DeFi

Our idea is to create a modular decentralized working structure where each new vertical is completely independent of another one.

All verticals will be aligned with UNITE DAO values and mission through a 5th vertical called Coordinator, which will be formed by representatives of all Verticals and Working Groups.

Within each vertical, we find new branches, what we call WORKING GROUPS. Each working group focuses its effort on the development of a specific STANDARD. 

Each working group has its resources, community, and team. They are fully autonomous. If necessary, a working group can create a new branch, just as the ramifications originate on each vertical. A WORKING GROUP can shunt from an existing ONE.

## Working Groups Structure

A working group is an autonomous organization within UNITE DAO. The final goal of a WG is the creation of new standards.

A WORKING GROUP can be structured depending on its necessities. Nevertheless, our idea is to introduce some specific roles. Roles are directly related to the contribution and the responsibility each person wants to take.

1. Community, composed by the whole community of UNITE DAO.
2. Participants (WIP)
3. Contributors(WIP)
4. Committee(WIP)

Individual or collective “reputation” among the community will define your role within the WG. This process of Forging ahead carries with it some requirements, to align new responsibility with skin on the game.
