# Token Swaps
**$FIDE x $X Token Swap Alignment**

This partnership agreement aims to align the interest of the parties to deepen the collaboration between the organizations on the following topics; 

**Pre-Launch**

UniteDAO and [candidate DAO] have coordinated closely to determine standards in [specific standard area, e.g. NFTs, Finance, DAO tooling, etc.].

Pursuant to this UniteDAO will support [candidate DAO] in developing liquidity for the liquidity pair $FIDE-$X and the $FIDE governance token by stewarding liquidity on and relationships with the Balancer protocol. 

[We should also describe potential liquidity pool setups, and their token % here]

**Token alignment**

To align governance interests between the two organizations, we propose facilitating an initial token swap between $FIDE and $X. 

We propose swapping $XX,XXX worth of $Fide at Whitelist valuation to be swapped for $XX,XXX of $X tokens using the 30-day TWAP.

The ideal timeline for this swap would be: [Date], align on terms, [Date] put up for vote, [Date], execute and publish about it a couple hours ahead of the launch to show alignment and drive more traffic.

**Use of Funds**

To ensure long-term alignment, UniteDAO will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the [candidate DAO] ecosystem.

**Post-Launch**

After the launch UniteDAO and [Candidate DAO] will collaborate on co-marketing efforts where both organizations will profit from each otherâ€™s reach and marketing activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where applicable.

In addition, we will continue to explore co-development opportunities, such as:

- co-development of standards
- co-funding of standards development from UniteDAO contributors
- etc

Finally, UniteDAO and [Candidate DAO] will proactively participate in each other's Governance to help steer each DAO, by [set benchmark of voting, delegation, etc].
