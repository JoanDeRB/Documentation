# Tokenomics

## Introduction to UNITE DAO Tokenomics
UNITE DAO aims to become a League of Protocols, looking for the creation of a blockchain ecosystem and community where to develop and evolve STANDARDS to minimize the friction barriers for the future of WEB 3 development. 

The second main goal is to achieve its financial independence for the long term. That means to be able to create a sustainable revenue income to continuously bankroll the creation of standards.

Both goals are based on FIDE, the native token of UNITE DAO. Its main purpose can be defined in 2 core concepts:
-Giving access and voting Power to the community members, through staking FIDE
-Sustainable value growth, catching the value created and being used as value accumulator.

## Fide features
-Governance. UNITE DAO team wants to bring as much decentralization and decision power to the whole community.  FIDE token will be one of the mechanisms to get involved into the day to day of UNITE DAO governance, as well as allow the participants to STANDARDS creation. 

-Capital allocation. Capital allocation. Treasury decisions, as well as the future allocation of the income generated from those inversions, will be decided through capital allocation voting power. Each investor will have the right to reallocate capital to finance the development of the standard of its own decision.  

-Safety module. In case something went wrong with staking stablecoins contributed by the different working groups, the FIDE safety module will act as a last resource to face any possible shortfall.

-Fide Rewards. As a reward, staked FIDEs will get more FIDE in a fair distribution among the community. Participation in the UNITE DAO community will also be incentivized.
