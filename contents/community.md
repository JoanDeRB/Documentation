# Building Community


Project success also depends on a solid and engaged community. So let's dive deep into the Unite DAO Community-Building Strategy to understand how we will build.


## Goals:

- Build a solid and engaged community.
- Create and maintain community channels: Discord, Twitter, Telegram, Youtube.
- Create Content Strategies for the different channels.


## Key questions:

- *What macro content will we create?*
- *On what channels will we create it?*
- *How will we repurpose Macro-content into Micro?*
- *How will we distribute that Micro-content?*
- *How will we listen to our audience?*
- *How will we measure our KPI’s?*


## Macro-content:

- Youtube + Medium + Live Events (Situational Marketing)

Our focus will be on the Youtube channel. This will be our main Macro-content channel. The first 6 episodes will be with Alex Puig ([cryptobenkei](https://github.com/cryptobenkei)) and Arturas Salnikovas ([art0eth](https://github.com/art0eth)). Later we will invite other team members from different departments to speak and share experiences. After that, we will start with Guests - there will be a schedule of invitations with crypto projects and entrepreneurs.

## Micro-content:

- Social media posts

We have prepared the main social media platforms for our content distribution. We will make a long-form video for Youtube first, then - we will distribute this video in short chunks across all our social media channels: Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Medium, Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Substack.


# Content strategy:

1. **Inspiration** — Problems and questions people ask in our niche. 
We also can look at our socials and get inspiration for content. 

2. **Keywords** — Main keywords. 
E.g., Web3 Standards, NFT gaming, Interoperability, DAO. 
Keywords will be the central axis where we will create our content around. 

3. **Keyword Research** — Use Google and Youtube auto-complete functions to find keywords.

4. **Develop Content Ideas** — Three main categories of content:
 - *Motivational content - 5 keywords x 10 ideas = 50 peaces of content.*
 - *Educational content - 5 keywords x 10 ideas = 50 peaces of content.*
 - *Actionable content - 5 keywords x 10 ideas = 50 peaces of content.*

`3 categories of content X 5 keywords X 10 ideas each = 150 content/month`

5. **Create amazing content** — Start content production,produce anything that adds value to the viewer/reader.

 Make sure 3 things are right:
- Titles
- Keywords
- Links

6. **Content Marketing** — Start promoting the content:
- Organic — All our social network channels. 
- Paid — Youtube, LinkedIn, and Facebook Ads.

## Re-Use the Content (Micro-content):

- Break the Youtube videos into chunks/sections.
- Optimize the copy. Turn chunks/sections into social media posts.
- Short paragraphs - hook the reader.
- Make it scannable/readable.
- Create graphics/pictures for the posts.


## Post Formula:

1. (Headline)
2. Hook
3. Pain Points
4. Solution
5. CTA


## Content Calendar and Tools:

- Create a content calendar. We use Sprout Social to schedule all posts.
- No more than 30 days upfront.
- Always leave some space for new ideas and breaking news.


## Email Marketing:
